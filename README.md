Pepper is a humanoid-robot developed by Softbankrobotics that let us code and program her through set of API's
I'm exploring one at my company and am very excited to abe among the few people to get to do so in a population of over 1000 people

1. Link to Google I/O kickstart video (Watch from 2:00 mins) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd96g8vBUWk
2. Itâ€™s development can be using Python Libraries OR Android Plugin which should be convenient as the documentation is quite clear
